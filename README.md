# MRI-Synthesis-from-CT-for-Pelvic-Region
This project presents a fully 3D deep learning pipeline for translating pelvic CT scans into synthetic MRI volumes using paired data. It leverages GAN architectures with patch-wise training for efficiency and supports multiple generators such as 3D UNet and Swin-UNETR.
